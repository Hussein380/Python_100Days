# Pomodoro Timer App

![Pomodoro Timer](demo.png)

## Description

This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application helps users stay focused and productive by implementing the Pomodoro Technique.

## Features

- **Timer Mechanism**: The application implements the Pomodoro Technique, alternating between work sessions and short breaks. Each work session lasts for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute short break. After completing 4 work sessions, a longer break of 20 minutes is provided.

- **Countdown Mechanism**: The countdown timer dynamically displays the remaining time for each work session or break. It updates every second until the session ends.

- **Reset Functionality**: Users can reset the timer at any time, resetting the session count and stopping the current session.

- **Visual Feedback**: The timer interface provides visual feedback by changing colors and displaying session types (work, short break, long break) dynamically.

- **Checkmarks**: Upon completing a work session, checkmarks are displayed to indicate the number of completed work sessions.
